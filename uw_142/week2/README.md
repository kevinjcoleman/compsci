Computer scientists use the word “parameter” broadly to mean both what appears in the method header (the formal parameter) and what appears in the method call (the actual parameter).

### Formal Parameter
A variable that appears inside parentheses in the header of a method that is used to generalize the method’s behavior.

### Actual Parameter
A specific value or expression that appears inside parentheses in a method call.

The word “argument” is often used as a synonym for “parameter,” as in “These are the arguments I’m passing to this method.” Some people prefer to reserve the word “argument” for actual parameters and the word “parameter” for formal parameters.

###  multiple params
public static void <name>(<type> <name>, ..., <type> <name>) { <statement>;
<statement>; ... <statement>;
}
