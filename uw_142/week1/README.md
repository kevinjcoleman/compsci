### Processing User Interfaces ...
program
a set of instructions carried out by a computer
program excecution
the act of carrying out the instructions of a given computer program
programming language is a systemic set of rules used to describe computations in a format editable to humans,

### Computer science
Is the study of computational devices and the study of computation itself, including algorithms.

### Compiler
A program that translates a computer program written in one language into an equivalent program in another language (often, but not always, translating from a high-level language into machine language).

**Java Class Libraries are sort of like a gem**

### 3 Types of errors
• Syntax errors occur when you misuse Java. They are the programming equivalent of bad grammar and are caught by the Java compiler.
• Logic errors occur when you write code that doesn’t perform the task it is intended to perform.
• Runtime errors are logic errors that are so severe that Java stops your program from executing.

#### Logic errors are also called bugs. Computer programmers use words like “bug- ridden” and “buggy” to describe poorly written programs, and the process of find- ing and eliminating bugs from programs is called debugging.

### Decomposition
A separation into discernible parts, each of which is simpler than the whole.

### Iterative Enhancement
The process of producing a program in stages, adding new functionality at each stage. A key feature of each iterative step is that you can test it to make sure that piece works before moving on.

### Data Type
A name for a category of data values that are all related, as in type int in Java, which is used to represent integer values.

###Control structure
A programming construct that affects the flow of a program's execution.
