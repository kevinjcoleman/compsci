Constructor (Construct)
A method that creates and initializes an object. Objects in Java programs must be constructed before they can be used.


Package
A collection of related Java classes.
Import Declaration
A request to access a specific Java package.

Cumulative Algorithm
An operation in which an overall value is computed incrementally, often using a loop.


Precondition
A condition that must be true before a method executes in order to guarantee that the method can perform its task.
Postcondition
A condition that the method guarantees will be true after it finishes executing, as long as the preconditions were true before the method was called.

The analogous concept in programming is that each method should have a clear purpose and set of responsibilities. This characteristic of computer programs is called cohesion.
Cohesion
A desirable quality in which the responsibilities of a method or process are closely related to each other.

Coupling
An undesirable state in which two methods or processes rigidly depend on each other.

Chaining
An undesirable design in which a “chain” of several methods call each other without returning the overall flow of control to main.
